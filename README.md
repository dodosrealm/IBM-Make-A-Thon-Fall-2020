# IBM-Make-A-Thon-Fall-2020
Inspiration:
Covid-19 has challenged us all in ways that we've never been challenged before, and with that comes no exclusion to a change in the way we learn. For many students, time management has become a driving factor towards success, as such, we wanted to create a tool that can assist students with achieving their academic goals. 

Our Mission:
 Our goal for this project is creating a website capable of providing students with a simple and quick transition into Distance Leaning, whilst supplying the user with as many tips necessary to be able to excel in the class through time management. This first rendition of our website specifically focuses on the age-range of 7-14 year old, in order to produce an MVP (minimum viable product) showcasing what we plan on accomplishing.

Technology Used:
Zoom | Google Docs| Whatsapp | Google Sites| IBM Watson AI | OBS 

Challenges:
One of the major challenges we faced was displaying the information collected from the chat bot on googles calendar.

Our Future:
Display user's calendar with tasks and assignment added using Watson AI Chatbot.

Utilize IBM Cloud technology to store the users information.  

Create ranking so as to boost motivation amongst users.

Allocate awards for meeting assignment deadlines and penalties for missed assignments.

Appeal to other age groups.

What we have learned:
Through IBM we were able to learned how to build and deploy a chatbot.

The teammates have learned how to utilize google sites.

As a result of this project, we have also learned how to work as a team to accomplish a common goal.
